## Business and Technical requirements (Main task)

- [x] Presented an application capable of searching for species by their vernacular name and scientific name.
- [x] Presented the count of species that were observed
- [x] Included a visualization of a timeline when selected species were observed
- [x] Implemented the App using shinyModules
- [x] Unit tests have been added for the most important functions and cover edge cases

# Instructions for New Developers

If you are a new developer contributing to this project, follow these steps to set up your development environment:

### Prerequisites

- R installed on your machine. You can download it from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).

-  Download RStudio: Visit the [RStudio download page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).
   - Choose the appropriate version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
   - Download and run the installer.

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://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@github.com/caiogbb/Appsilon_test.git
```

# Application infrastructure

## ETL process

The data corresponding to this application contains information from the entire planet Earth, which corresponds to 22GB. Processing this data on a local machine is impractical.

Therefore, to process this dataset `Spark` was used, the codes with the application in R are found in `ETL`. In summary, the data is being loaded with the help of the `sparklyr` package, after loading the data considering some jobs, a filter was carried out to select only species located in Poland. After this process, the filtered dataset was saved in CSV to be consumed by the App, resulting in a size of approximately 25MB.

## Main Functions

The core functionality of the app is driven by two main functions defined in the `example.R` script:

#### `mapa_function`

The `mapa_function` is responsible for constructing a map of species based on latitude and longitude information. It utilizes the `leaflet` library to create interactive and visually appealing maps.

#### `time_series_function`

The `time_series_function` is used to generate time series plots of species observation events over time. It relies on the plotly library to create dynamic and interactive time series graphs.

## Shiny Modules

To facilitate the creation of the application, modularization of the application was considered, with the aim of fixing future bugs more quickly

#### `filterModuleUI` and `filterModule`

The `filterModuleUI` and 'filterModule' are responsible for creating buttons and interacting data with the application, generating eventReactive and action buttons to make viewing more pleasant with just a few clicks on the screen.

#### `mapModuleUI`, `mapModule`, `timeSeriesModuleUI` and `timeSeriesModule`

The `mapModuleUI`, `mapModule`, `timeSeriesModuleUI` and `timeSeriesModule` are responsible for making the app's buttons come to life, making the user consider viewing the species' location map and the time series of events presented for those species

#### `speciesCountModuleUI` and`speciesCountModule`

The `speciesCountModuleUI`, `speciesCountModule` are responsible for calculating the number of observations that a given species was presented in the dataset

## Unit test

A unit test was performed to investigate whether the `mapa_function` and `time_series_function` functions are working correctly. This test can be found in `tests/unit_test.R`

# Comments about `app.R`

- It presents a structure considering the Shinydashboard, however, with the help of the fresh package, the entire Beautiful UI was modified to an interface different from the standard presented by Shinydashboard.

- The main page does not remain blank for users, it was considered including a description together with an instruction on how the application should be used, and the explanation will be maintained during the use of the app to facilitate learning.

- Remember the application is deployed in the AWS cloud, that is, it is in production, any change in the `app.R` and `examples.R` and `example-Module.R` codes directly affects the deployment of the Model.

- If you have any questions about the model's infrastructure, please contact me via my personal email: cbalieiro39@gmail.com
